SQL vs NOSQL

NOSQL :
NoSQL main benefit is the data can be stored in any structure there is no specific relationships between entities
In SQL there are specific relation ship so in case we need to migrate the whole data model it is very tough, In Nosql since there are no relations between the entities 
we can remodel as need.

horizontal scaling is available in nosql but in sql vertical scaling is main oprion

scaling and storing huge data in mongo db is chepaer and easy to maintian, sql db is costly

Nosql is not good enough when there needs to be huge reporting and dataminig queries are very advanced as there are no specific relationship between entities

ACID is supported by mongo but not by all other no sql DBS, however over multi document transaction max time is 15 second
so in cases when millions of data inserted within same transactionn NOSQL is not good enough

benefits of sql
in case data model is fixed and stable we cna use SQL
in case transaction suport is needed for more than15 second or huge amount we can go for sql
however it is tough to modify and upgrade db model as relationships are present
vertical scaling is costly
Better ACID support

Difference btween insert method and save method of mongoRepository/mongoTemplate
insert -> if id is missing that a new document is created in colection with autogenerated value for id
	   -> if id is present
	   					-> if id do not exist in DB then it creates a new document with that id mentioned
	   					-> if id exist in DB an exceptionw tih duplicatiokecyfound excpetion is thrown
	   					
save- > if id is missing that a new document is created in colection with autogenerated value for id
      -> if id is present
                        -> if id do not exist in DB then it creates a new document with that id mentioned
	   					-> if id exist in DB it overrides the other fields of document with the same id and a new document is not inserted in db
	   					
In mongo DB if id is given the same id can be used to insert otherwise autogenrated id is used
